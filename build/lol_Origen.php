            Origen return to the top flight of European competition, ready to challenge the best teams in the LEC.
          </h1>
          <p1>
            Origen should be a name familiar to LEC fans: they first entered the fray in 2014 and hit the ground running, chalking up an impressive second-place finish during the 2015 Summer Split, and even made it as far as the semifinals at the World Championship that same year. Now partnered with the same organisation behind Counter-Strike: Global Offensive powerhouse Astralis, they’re set to return to Europe’s top competition where they hope to leave their mark on the LEC. With plenty of history behind this team, the new-look Origen will be looking to looking to impress, and it’s clear from the blueprint they’re following that they have nothing but success in mind.
