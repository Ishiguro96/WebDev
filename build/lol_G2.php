            The Spanish giants are a European mainstay with first place finishes and a Rift Rivals trophy to their name. G2 are looking to continue their high flying performance throughout 2019.

            Since entering the EU LCS in 2016, G2 Esports have made their mark on League of Legends and esports as a whole, managing a stable of over 50 esports athletes across several games and continents and entertaining fans across the globe. With a record four back to back playoff victories in 2016 and 2017, a Rift Rivals victory and multiple Worlds appearances including reaching the semifinals in 2018, the team are set to be an intimidating presence in LEC in 2019. The squad are known as risk takers, and play to entertain as much as they do to win – though they’ve already proved they can have their cake and eat it on the Rift with the strat. Their opponents will have to guard closely against their hallmark 1-3-1 composition to avoid being added to G2 Esports’ lengthy list of vanquished opponents.
