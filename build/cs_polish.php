          <p>Well... If any of you is interested in esport for quit a time should be able to name all those players above. If not... you should reconsider your behave. The rest on you might need some explanation.
            These are the best polish players on professional CS:GO arena. Through 3 maybe 3,5 years ( 2014-2018 few first months) they were playing as Virtus.Pro. This team was considered as one of the best in the world ...
            which they showed quit well winning 2014 World Championship.
            <br>
            Here you can see those "huge" names and see their current organisations.

          </p>
          <p>
            But than 2018 comes... at the very beginning of this year they simply broke down. But it brings also some good news to fans.
            While VP is still one of the best organisations in CS:GO, they aquired 2 opponents (AGO Esports and Team Kinguin) at the similar level.
            Lets see whatt do we know about those 3 teams these days.

            Due to lasten changes in team th core of the team is untuched (PashaBiceps and NEO) while the rest is changed in any possible way. In last few months the teams
            is back on the right track but they still need a lot of time to get back to Golden 5 times. You can see all of theirs achivments and so on <a class="Team" id="link" href="https://virtus.pro/pl/lineup/csgo">here</a>

            <br>
            In this <a class="Team" id="link" href="https://virtus.pro/pl/lineup/csgo">squad</a> particularly they are a new team. With help of former Legia Warszawa owners they quickly become one of the best teams in Europe at the moment.
            They were underdogs for a long time becaouse none of them were known on international arena. That's why their performence in this year becomes such a surprise. As an organisations their are still learning and have a potential for one of the best org's
            in or country. If you would like to stay in contact with their moves as an oragnisation you should follo them <a class="Team" id="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/agoesports/">here</a> or in any social media including you tube.

          <h1 class="text-center">
            Team Kinguin

            <img class="lol-content-image" src="Assets/Images/kinguin_team.jpg" alt="LoL">
            <br>
            Organisation on it's own is few years old but till 1 year ago they have been mostly associeted with LoL or Dota. But when TaZ joined them something have changed. But <a class="Team" id="link" href="https://virtus.pro/pl/lineup/csgo">those</a> guys are curently
            ( in my honest opinion) the best polish CS:GO team right now. They won with Virtus recently, and thanks to that Team Kinguin is the only polish team wich will be playing in ESL Pro League - the best CS:GO professional league.
